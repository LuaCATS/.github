# LuaCATS
Hello! üëã

LuaCATS stands for "Lua Comment And Type System", which is the system used by [Sumneko](https://github.com/sumneko)'s [Lua Language Server][lls]. This organization provides a place for community projects to live. These projects are definition files for popular libraries/frameworks, plugins, and more!

While the projects in this organization are intended to be used with the [Lua Language Server][lls], they can still be used and forked for other purposes. Many of the repositories in this organization are used by [LLS-Addons][LLS-Addons], a repository that is used by the addon manager of the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) for the [Lua Language Server][lls].

To get involved, hop in to any project that interests you, read the `CONTRIBUTING.md`, open an issue, or open a pull request! ‚ù§
